# Assignment 1: Neovim practice

In this assignment, you will practice Neovim, a text editor that we use for this course. There are two simple tasks that you need to do.

## Task 0

Before you get started, spend a few minutes and read [this article](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html). There are many articles that talk about using vi and I believe it is one of the better-written articles. Don't miss the first misconception about the modal editing as it describes the correct way to use vi.

## Task 1

In this task, use `nvim` to follow a tutorial. First, make sure you are in the directory for this assignment (`a1`). Start `nvim`. You do not need to open any file. After that, enter `:Tutor`, which will start a built-in tutorial. Finish the tutorial and save the content (including your modifications) to a new file named `tutor` (if you finish the tutorial, you will know how to save the content that you are editing to a new file). Remember, as the above linked article describes, your workflow is that "you are *always* in normal mode, and only enter insert mode for *short bursts* of typing text, after which you press <Esc> to go to normal mode."

After you're done, use `git` to push your `tutor` file to your remote GitHub Classroom repo.

## Tips

There are many good online webpages that you can use to quickly look up vi commands. We highly recommend to open one of those in your browser and keep it in the background throughout the semester, so you can easily find the commands that you want to use. For example, [this](https://vim.rtorr.com) is a good one to use. Since vi has many more useful commands that the tutorial does not mention, you can try out the commands that the above linked cheat sheet describes.
