# Assignment 1: Neovim practice

In this assignment, you will practice Neovim, a text editor that we use for this course. There are two simple tasks that you need to do.

## Task 0

Before you get started, spend a few minutes and read [this article](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html). There are many articles that talk about using vi and I believe it is one of the better-written articles. Don't miss the first misconception about the modal editing as it describes the correct way to use vi.

## Task 1

In this task, use `nvim` to follow a tutorial. First, make sure you are in the directory for this assignment (`a1`). Start `nvim`. You do not need to open any file. After that, enter `:Tutor`, which will start a built-in tutorial. Finish the tutorial and save the content (including your modifications) to a new file named `tutor` (if you finish the tutorial, you will know how to save the content that you are editing to a new file). Remember, as the above linked article describes, your workflow is that "you are *always* in normal mode, and only enter insert mode for *short bursts* of typing text, after which you press <Esc> to go to normal mode."

After you're done, use `git` to push your `tutor` file to your remote GitHub Classroom repo.
