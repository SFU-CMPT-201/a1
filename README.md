# Assignment 1: Neovim practice

(**Navigation**: Type `q` to exit. Type `b` to go back to the previous page. Type `[Space]` to go to the next page. Type `j` to scroll down by one line. Type `k` to scroll up by one line.)

In this assignment, you will practice Neovim, a text editor that we use for this course. There are three simple tasks that you need to finish as follows.

## Task 0

Before you get started, spend a few minutes and read [this article](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html). There are many articles that talk about the advantages of using vi and I believe it is one of the more well-written articles. Make sure you read the first misconception about the modal editing as it describes the correct way to use vi.

## Task 1

In this task, use `nvim` to write a `main()` function inside a file named `main.c`. The `main()` function should invoke every single function in the `lib.c` file and exit with a success exit code (`0`). There is an executable named `grader` that you can run and check your score. As the above linked article describes perfectly, your workflow is that "you are *always* in normal mode, and only enter insert mode for *short bursts* of typing text, after which you press <Esc> to go to normal mode."

## Task 2



(**Navigation**: Type `q` to exit. Type `b` to go back to the previous page. Type `[Space]` to go to the next page. Type `j` to scroll down by one line. Type `k` to scroll up by one line.)
